# Heart-disease-classification-problem

Project 2: Heart-disease Classifiction. In this project, I used different types of classification algorithms like KNN,LOGISTIC REGRESSION AND RANDOMFORESTCALSSIFIER. I also used SEABORN to visualize the correlation matrix . Among them Logistic regression give maximum accuracy :88%.

Tools and techniques used: Python, sklearn,seaborn, NumPy, matplotlib.
